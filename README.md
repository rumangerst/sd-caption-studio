# SD Caption Studio

Yet another tool to make manual captioning easier. Currently works with data sets that contain images and a caption
txt file in the same directory.

## Building

Requires Maven and Java 8 for building (yes, Java 8, because I have certain freedoms with it).

```bash 
mvn package # Create *.jar file
```
